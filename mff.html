      						<h3>Chicken Curry</h3>
      						<p>I enjoy chicken curries because the chicken is simmered in a tomato, onion, ginger, and garlic-based gravy with spices. It is incredibly hot and delicious, making it my favorite food. Chicken may be prepared in a variety of ways to make different curries, but chicken curry is a simple dish that even bachelors can make.</p>

      						<h3>Ramen</h3>
      						<p>Due to the fact that fat and carbohydrates are such crucial components of flavor in ramen, I like it. It is a miracle food with the ideal ratio of fat, carbohydrates, and amino acids. They blend together harmoniously in a bowl of ramen. It is tasty and extremely addicting due to this balance.</p>

      						<h3>Rabokki</h3>
      						<p>I enjoy rabokki because it has a texture and flavor that most Caribbean and African people are accustomed to, particularly the rice cake, which has a flavor reminiscent of cooked dumplings. This is what I would say because both the individual fishcakes and the texture as a whole are rather soft and chewy.</p>

      						<h3>Spaghetti</h3>
      						<p>I enjoy spaghetti Filipino spaghetti gets its distinct sweetness from banana ketchup, which is exported to dozens of countries with sizable Filipino populations, instead of the savory tang a conventional tomato-based spaghetti sauce has.</p>

      						<h3>Fruit Salad</h3>
      						<p>Condensed milk, table cream, and canned fruit cocktail are the main ingredients in the fruit salad I like. Although this should not be confused with the buko salad, which uses only young coconut, there are certain variants that also include buko or young coconut.</p>

      						<h3>Sunny Side Up Egg</h3>
      						<p>It's only a matter of myÂ personal preference, which is why I enjoy it. Sunny side up is more enticing to the eye. Over easy is less aesthetically pleasing than a sunny side up egg because of the yolk's vivid color. As a result, it is the kind of egg that is most frequently used to top salads, polenta, bibimbap, and other dishes.</p>
