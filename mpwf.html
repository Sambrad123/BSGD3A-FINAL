      						<h3>With my friend Lesley</h3>
      						<p>Sometimes, all you need for therapy is to spend time with your best friend. Keep the people who heard you when you were silent. Instead of walking alone in the light, I would like to do so with a companion. A true friend accepts you for who you are while also assisting you in becoming the person you should be.</p>

      						<h3>With my friend Marez</h3>
      						<p>When my memory lapses, a friend sings the song to me since she knows it by heart. There are instances when you meet someone and instantly click with them. You feel at ease around them and don't feel the need to put up a show or act in any way. I laugh a little louder, weep a little less, and grin a lot more because of you.</p>

      						<h3>With my friend Miray</h3>
      						<p>That's when I grasped the meaning of a loyal buddy. Someone who would always be there for you, even when you were flawed, unclear, or in the wrong, since that is what friends are for. The shared perception of reality is what makes people want to be friends.

      						<h3>My Best Friends</h3>
      						<p>The bond between best friends is virtually unexplainable. No matter what the situation, they are there for you, keeping solely your best interests in mind while seeing the situation objectively. More than anybody else, your best buddy is the person you can confide in. They may even have a better understanding of you than you do.</p>

      						<p>The best memories are created through chaotic times with friends.
We have memories behind us, people next to us, and dreams ahead us. No matter what is happening in my life right now, I adore those haphazard memories that make me grin. Friends turn become our family of choice. I've made pals that I'll cherish forever. Our recollections won't ever deteriorate.</p>

      						<h3>My dancemates</h3>
      						<p>They share it. True friends are like diamonds—bright, beautiful, valuable, and always in style. A good friend knows all your stories. A best friend helped you create them. A friend is someone who makes it easy to believe in yourself. There’s nothing better than a friend, unless it is a friend with chocolate. Rare as is true love, true friendship is rarer.</p>
