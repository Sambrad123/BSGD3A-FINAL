				<h2 class="head">These are my favorite series</h2>
				<p class="header">Contrary to popular belief, anime are not merely cartoons for kids to watch; they are a type of art that has gained popularity recently. As a fan of anime, you probably already understand the profundity and significance of each spoken statement made by anime characters, particularly in well-known shows like Attack on Titan, Naruto, and Fairytail..</p>

      						<h3>Naruto</h3>
      						<p>I love naruto life because it is a wonderful story about his life that he wants to get his dream. Even his family died his always keep moving when his alone.</p>

      					<h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
      					<p>I like this story because it centers on Eren Yeager, who swears to wipe out the Titans after they destroy his hometown and take his mother's life in a world where humanity is compelled to live in cities surrounded by three enormous walls to defend them from enormous man-eating humanoids known as Titans.</p>

      					<h3>Kaichou wa maid-sama</h3>
      					<p>I love this anime. It is my favorite so far and I totally want a second season. I know that I'm not the only one who want to watch the season two and there are a lot of people are still waiting for it</p>

      					<h3>Darling in the Franxx</h3>
      					<p>I like this story because it is set in a dystopian future where children are artificially created and indoctrinated solely to defend the remnants of civilization. The story follows a squad of ten pilots, particularly focusing on the partnership between Hiro, a former prodigy, and Zero Two, a hybrid human and elite pilot who aspires to become entirely human.</p>

    						<img src="assets/image/fairytail.jpeg" alt="Mountains" class="img5">
      						<h3>Fairytail</h3>
      						<p>Live today – tomorrow is not guaranteed. Ideas are useless if they remain unused. Dream without being scared, love without knowing limits. Be brave to live differently. Don't look at me funny. If you're tired, keep going. Self-confidence – the best outfit. Grow through what you're going through.</p>

      						<h3>Oshi no ko</h3>
      						<p>I like this anime because tt follows a doctor and his recently-deceased patient who became reborn as twins to a famous Japanese pop idol and navigate the highs and lows of the country's entertainment industry as they grow up together through their lives. An anime television series adaptation produced by Doga Kobo premiered in April 2023.</p>
